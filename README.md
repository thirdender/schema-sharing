# Schema Sharing

## Goals

With the current interest in a distributed social media network, it might be possible to recreate [Freenet](https://freenetproject.org/) in a browser-only context (using WebRTC and IndexedDB).

This project aims to provide a UI for editing content that exposes content fields and relationships based on the [schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary.


## Running locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The simplest way to get started is to pull this project, then from the project directory run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn run start
```
